## Towards more Sustainability: A Literature Review where Bioeconomy meets Blockchain
### A contribution to the WI2019 „Human Practice, Digital Ecologies, our Future“ 
### Track: Umweltinformatik und nachhaltiges Wirtschaften


### Abstract
On the one hand, we have a gradually grown awareness and importance of sustainability and natural resources. On the other hand, blockchain technology gains increasingly interest and may have ecological, economical, and social potential and possible impact that have not been completely examined so far. To present the state-of-the-art and hot topics at this, bioecnomy, natural resources, and blockchain are reviewed equally and future research threads are outlined. While doing so, we follow a systematic literature review procedure [1] hybridized with text mining and a classification algorithm to enhance our data collection phase. Consequently, each of the resulting cluster describes a dedicated research thread and ends up with real-word and possibly future-potential implications driven by blockchain technology. Overall, this review gives important insights on how blockchain was and could be engaged to add value towards sustainability at bioecnomy and natural resources.
